# Contributing to DDoS Simulation Lab

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DDoS Simulation Lab project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this educational cybersecurity project.

## Code of Conduct

### Ethical Use Commitment

By contributing to this project, you agree to:

- Use this software exclusively for educational and research purposes
- Never use this software for malicious attacks or illegal activities
- Respect network policies and legal boundaries
- Promote responsible cybersecurity education
- Help maintain the educational integrity of this project

## How to Contribute

### 1. Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in attack modules, C2 server, or bot clients
- **Educational enhancements**: Improve learning materials and documentation
- **Safety improvements**: Enhance safety mechanisms and validation
- **New attack types**: Add new educational attack simulations
- **Monitoring tools**: Improve analysis and visualization capabilities
- **Documentation**: Enhance guides, tutorials, and technical documentation
- **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests
- **Performance optimizations**: Improve system efficiency

### 2. Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Murali8823/ddos.git
   cd ddos
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and modular

#### Example Code Style:
```python
async def validate_attack_target(self, config: AttackConfig) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Validate that an attack target is safe and allowed.
    
    Args:
        config: Attack configuration to validate
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (is_valid, reason_message)
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        return True, "Validation successful"
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Validation error: {e}")
        return False, f"Validation failed: {str(e)}"
```

#### Safety First
- All new attack modules must include safety validation
- Network boundary checking is mandatory
- Resource monitoring must be implemented
- Emergency stop functionality must be preserved

#### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Test safety mechanisms thoroughly
- Include integration tests for new attack types
- Verify educational value of new features
